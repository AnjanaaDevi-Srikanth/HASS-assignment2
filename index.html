<h1 style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-size:40px;text-align: center;">Why, Idiom, why?</h1>
<h2>A study of not-so-flawless data charts</h2>
<body>
<h2 style="font-size:25px;"><br>Example 1: <br><br></h2>
<img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Most-Spoken-Languages-1-1.png?w=770&resize=770%2C770" alt="The World's most spoken languages Source: Al Jazeera">
<p> <br>At first glance, the chart looks simple, eye-catching and informative. To understand why it is flawed, let's look at what the chart is trying to say.<br><br> </p>
<p> Why is the chart designed this way? <br> Al Jazeera designed this chart for World Mother Language Day on 21 February. This chart maps the most widely spoken languages by native and non-native speakers across the world. The languages are grouped and coloured according to the family that the language belongs to. The particular way the languages are grouped leads me to believe that the basic type of chart used is a packed circle chart. </p>
<img src="https://datavizproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DVP_1_100-67.png" alt="Packed Circle Chart" >
<p> Circle packing provides a good overview of large data sets and the clear representation of groupings and structural relationships.<br><br> It seems to me that the elements are tesselated to remove negative spaces and improve the readability of the chart. It also helps that the outline is a circle which symbolises the world.</p>
<p><br> What is wrong with this great-looking chart? </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p> Idiom Issue: </p>
            <ol> 
                <li>The idea is to understand how widely many languages are spoken based on the size of each tesselation. If the numbers of the populations speaking English and Mandarin Chinese weren't written, would it be so clear? </li>
                <li>The bold line demarcating the language families seems unnecessary as they are differentiated by colour anyway. </li>
                <li>It seems to me that the idiom has been chosen predominantly because the circular outline symbolises the Earth. </li>
            </ol>
        </li> <br>
        <li>
            <p> Data issue: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Egyptian Arabic and Standard Arabic are shown as two different data points, when in fact Egyptian Arabic is a dialect and not a formal language. Given that other languages like English and Hindi also have dialects, it seems that the dialects are selectively added to visualise the language families in a particular way.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
<p> Suggestions</p>
<img src="https://datavizproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DVP_101_200-01.png" alt="Grouped Bubble Chart" >
<ul>
    <li>
        <p> A simple grouped bubble chart will easily let the viewer compare the sizes of speaker populations of each language. </p>
    </li>
    <li> If the chart is made interactive so that the viewer can hover the mouse over a circle (or a formal language) and it splits into smaller circles of the most widely spoken dialects of that language, it will solve the data issue.</li>
</ul>
<h2><br><br>Example 2: <br><br></h2>
<img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/96/185096-050-5608F22F/World-Data-import-sources-pie-chart-United.jpg?w=690&h=388&c=crop" alt="United Arab Emirates: Major import sources" >
<p><br><br> The chart shows the major import sources of the United Arab Emirates in 2017. </p>
<p><br><br> Why is the chart designed this way? <br> The purpose of the chart is to compare the countries that are import sources to the United Arab Emirates. A pie chart has been designed by Britannica to depict this.  </p>
<img src="https://datavizproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/11-Pie-Chart.png" alt="Pie Chart" >
<p><br><br> A pie chart is divided into sectors, illustrating numerical proportion. In a pie chart, the arc length of each sector (and consequently its central angle and area), is proportional to the quantity it represents. <br><br></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p> Idiom Issue: </p>
        <ul> 
            <li>The area segments are hard to perceive, especially if the percentage labels are removed. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
<p> Suggestions</p>
<img src="https://datavizproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DVP_101_200-14.png" alt="Bar Chart" >
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p> A bar chart is a chart with rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values that they represent. In a horizontal bar chart, it is easy for the viewer to instantly ascertain the amount of imports from each country. </p>
